Using the “-h” option with any bedtools will report a list of all command line options. Report the base-pair overlap between the features in two BED files. bedtools intersect -a reads.bed -b genes.bed Report those entries in A that overlap NO entries in B. Like “grep -v” bedtools intersect -a reads.bed -b genes.bed -v Read BED A from STDIN. Useful for stringing together commands. For example, find genes that overlap LINEs but not SINEs. bedtools intersect -a genes.bed -b LINES.bed | \ bedtools intersect -a stdin -b SINEs.bed -v Find the closest ALU to each gene. bedtools closest -a genes.bed -b ALUs.bed Merge overlapping repetitive elements into a single entry, returning the number of entries merged. bedtools merge -i repeatMasker.bed -n Merge nearby repetitive elements into a single entry, so long as they are within 1000 bp of one another. bedtools merge -i repeatMasker.bed -d 1000 Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Table of Contents Quick start Install bedtools Use bedtools Previous topic Installation Next topic General usage This Page Show Source Quick search Navigation index next | previous | bedtools v2.31.0 &#187; &#169; Copyright 2009 - 2023, Aaron R.
